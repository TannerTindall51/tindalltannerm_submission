PCB Design for CPE301 Final utilizing KiCad. The instructions are as follows:

Two LEDs with  appropriate resistors connected to PORTD pins 5&6 in reverse logic. 
Two push buttons working in internal pullup mode connected to PORTD pins 2&3.
A 10K Potentiometer with a filter connected to PORTC pin 0. 
Female header pins to interface to LM34/35 to PORTC pin 1.
Female header pins for SPI0 interface with VCC and GND to accommodate the 128x32 (0.91") SPI OLED  Display 
Female header pin for I2C interface with VCC and GND to accommodate MPU6050 sensor.
Female headers on the shield to interface PORTE pins from Xplained Mini board.
Female headers to accommodate DS18S20 sensor to PC4.
Serial Interface to RFM95-98_LoRa_Module  Don't forget the SMA antenna This RF Module should be soldered on the shield, no through-hole connectors. 
Interface to DRV8833 DUAL MTR DRIVER CARRIER board and terminal block connectors to the side of the shield.
